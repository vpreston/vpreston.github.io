    <p> 
        I'm always excited to discuss my work; please get in touch if you would like to learn more. If you're a prospective applicant to any of the programs I've been involved in, I'm also happy to discuss my experience with you! Email (below) or LinkedIn (linked in footer) are the best ways to get in touch.

        I'm starting to consider the post-doctoral academic and research market. If you have an opportunity you would like to share with me or discuss further, I'd be thrilled and grateful.
