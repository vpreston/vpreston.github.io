			<p>I am currently a PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, splitting my time between the MIT AeroAstro department and the WHOI Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Departments. My work with advisers Nicholas Roy (MIT) and Anna Michel (WHOI) primarily focuses on embedding robotic technologies with intelligent regimes for modeling environmental phenomenon and making decisions with respect to improving those models or achieving some scientific objective.</p> 
			<p>I completed my Bachelors of Science at Olin College of Engineering in 2016 and earned my Masters of Science from MIT-WHOI in 2019. Following my undergraduate degree, I spent a year as a Fulbright Student Scholar conducting independent research on autonomous exploration strategies for a biomimetic, underwater vehicle under the supervision of Maarja Kruusmaa of the Tallinn University of Technology Centre for Biorobotics.</p>
			<p>I'm passionate about advancing the fields of robotics, environmental modeling, and environmental science through complementary technical development.</p>
